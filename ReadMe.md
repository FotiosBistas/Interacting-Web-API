## Project Description
This is a web application that interacts with a Web API, uses Handlebars for rendering the views, and MongoDB for storing and retrieving data.

The Web API is built with Node.js. It provides endpoints for interacting with the data stored in MongoDB. The view engine used in this project is Handlebars, which allows for easy rendering of dynamic data.

This project uses MongoDB to store data. MongoDB is a NoSQL document database that provides high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling. It is a good choice for this project because it allows for flexible and scalable data storage.

It is basically an e-shop platform that lets you choose from a variety of categories and products and add them to your cart in order to complete a purchase.
