# Interacting-Web-API

This is a 4th year semester project for Athens University of Economics And Business.
Scored 9.6/10.

## This project was built using the following technologies:
- **Node.js**
- **Handlebars.js**
- **MongoDB**
- **URL API**
- **Fetch API**
- **Express**
- **Async**
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**

## Project Description

This is a web application that allows users to interact with a database through a web API. It is built using Node.js and Express for the server, Handlebars for the front-end, and MongoDB for the database. The Fetch API is used for client-side communication with the server, and asynchronous programming techniques are used throughout.

It is basically an e-shop platform that lets you choose from a variety of categories and products and add them to your cart in order to complete a purchase.

Once you have the server running and have opened the web app in your browser, you can use it to interact with the database. The main page displays a list of items from the database and allows you to add new items in your cart.

Two modes are available by enabling or disabling the batch_writes. This allows us to run the website and choose between adding the products directly to the database, or storing the products offline temporarily using JavaScript and then adding them to the database.

## API Endpoints
The following endpoints are variations of the used interactions with the server:

-- GET /items (_Returns a list of all items in the database_)
-- POST /items(_Adds a new item to the database_)
